      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        The <strong>CSC_5IA21 – Project IA</strong> course is a group-based project designed to immerse students in real-world artificial intelligence challenges.
        Students form teams of <strong>4 to 6 members</strong> and select one of the proposed research-oriented projects.
        Each project focuses on applying and extending AI methods across domains such as deep learning, explainability,
        generative models, multimodal fusion, and trustworthy AI.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        The objective of this course is to help students develop research autonomy, teamwork skills,
        and an applied understanding of modern AI methods while working under the supervision of expert tutors.
        The project outcome includes code implementation, a written report, and a final oral presentation.
